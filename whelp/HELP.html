Help files are also connected to each other via hypertext links and
are listed in the index.

<strong>for a tag or data item in a <A HREF="Tree.html">Text
window</a> (Tree display)</strong>: Select an item by clicking on it
once, then choose <strong>Help</strong> in the pop-up menu. ACEDB will
display help on your selection. If the item is undocumented, ACEDB
will trace the branch of the object back to its root and display help
for <b>the first documented item </b>it finds. In general ACEDB tests for
the presence of:<p>

<ul>
<li>help for tags to the left and above original selection
<li>help for the class itself
<li>help for the display, in this case a Text window
<li><A HREF="acedb.html">general ACEDB help</a> (available from
the Main Window).

</ul>
Each help text is a single file in the directory $ACEDB/whelp.  Some
help files are supplied as part of the standard ACEDB distribution and
describe how to use the software. Others are added by data curators
and are database-specific. If ACEDB "asks" for a file but it is
missing, the fallback mechanism discussed above is used.<p>
