The Main Window presents a list of Classes, defined in the file
 <a href="Layout.html">wspec/layout.wrm</a>, which are the categories around which information is organized in the database. For example, a class called "Locus" could
be designed to store information about genetic markers.  Each class
consists of a list of members called "objects". The objects named ABC1
and xyz-1 might be members of the Locus class.<p>
