<h2>Add/Delete/Rename/Alias Objects</h2>

This window lets you perform various operations on whole objects.
Currently you can add new objects, delete entire objects, and rename
objects.  You must have acquired write access for it to work.<p>

First choose the class that you want to add to by picking on it.  Then
type the name of the object in the text entry box, then select the
operation you want to perform from the menu.  If you hit return and
the object already exists it is displayed in tree mode (useful for
confirming before renaming or destroying).<p>

<em>Double clicking on the classes does nothing</em>.  All actions are
initiated from the menu.<p>

<h3>Menu items:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Create</strong>: creates a new entry and displays an empty
tree window for it so you can get update mode and add data if you
want.

<li><strong>Edit</strong>: you must first pick a class and supply an
object name. The object is displayed and can be edited. See help for
<A HREF="Update.html">Update window</a> for more information.

<li><strong>Alias/Fuse</strong>: you must first pick a class and
supply an object name. You will then be prompted for an alias name.

<li><strong>Rename/Fuse</strong>: you first must pick a class and
supply an object name. You will then be prompted for a new name.  Fuse
does not work yet.

</ul>
