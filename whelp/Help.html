<h2>Help on Help</h2>

	Online Help is context-sensitive and can be associated with displays,
classes, tags, or fields. ACEDB displays help through its own HTML browser, though you can also browse it through Netscape for example.

	Where help has been documented, it is highly context sensitive: select the problematic function, tag, class... and click on help in the right-mouse button menu to call the <b>nearest</b>help message. Remember that though F1, F10, and HELP keys may not all work, at least one should.
