<h2>Main Keyset Window</h2>

 This is your central pool for data: in this window you collect the items <strong>Search</strong> has dredged up for you. From here you select, import, create keysets and compare data.

	This window is divided in control panel and selection window.

<h3>Selection Window</h3>   

<ul>
<li><strong>The scroll bar</strong> on the left is used to move in the set. The arrowheads move a page at a time, while left-dragging the green cursor scrolls continuously through the items. The middle button can also be used to center the green indicator of position directly on a spot.
<li>The selection window also reminds the search argument that was used to create this keyset, as well as the size of it in objects.
<li><b>The objects</b> themselves can be selected or deselected at will by left clicking on them. Dragging with the same button will select contiguous groups of items.To view an object double-click on it: depending on the format selected in the <a href="#showas">Show As..</a> menu.
</ul>

<h3>Keyset control panel</h3>

The top of a keyset window gives access to functions that will be applied to the selected parts of your keyset. Some of the buttons are pull down menus (indicated by <b>..</b> at the end) which you open with the right mouse button. The buttons are:

<a name="showas">
<H4>Show As</H4></a> This button can be used either as a pulldown menu or
simply by clicking it to toggle through its options. It controls how objects in the keyset will be displayed (i.e. gene position in numbers and on a map). The basic display options are <ul><li><a href="Tree.html">'Text'</a> to display as text 
<li>'Graph' to produce the default graphical display set for this class in the options.wrm file
</ul>

Clicking this button brings up the <A href="Biblio.html">Biblio display</A> window for the keyset.
<H4>More Info</H4>
Clicking this button brings up the <A href="Forest.html">Forest display</A> for the keyset.
<H4>Quit</H4>
Clicking this button quits the keyset window.
<H4>Query</H4>
This button may be used either to produce a pulldown menu for the
keyset (containing items related to querying the keyset) or can simply
be clicked upon. In the latter case, a text box appears below the
button allowing the user to perform a command line query on the
keyset.<P>


If used as a pulldown menu, there are currently options :-<P>


<B>Query</B> - Lets the user perform a command line query as with
clicking on the button.  <BR><B>Follow</B> - Brings up a tag chooser
window for the keyset, allowing the user to perform the 'follow' query
command on one of the tags (i.e. to produce a keyset containing all

neighbours</B> - Finds all objects in the database referred to by
items currently in the keyset.  <BR><B>Query by Example</B> - Allows
the user to perform a 'Query by Example' on the keyset.

pulldown menu containing options related to editing and copying of the
keyset. The menu options are as follows :-<P>


<B>Add/remove items one by one</B> - Allows the user to add or remove
items from the keyset one by one. Double clicking an item in the
keyset removes it. Double clicking an item in another keyset adds it

menu containing options for exporting and mailing the objects in the
keyset in various formats. Choosing each option calls up a new window
allowing the user to save the data into a file of the appropriate type
or click a 'Mail' button to mail the file to an e-mail address. The
various options are as follows :- <P>
