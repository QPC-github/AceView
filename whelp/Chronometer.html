<h2>Chronometer</h2>

  

An integrated profiler. The profiler runs only if the code is compiled
with the option -DCHRONO (see wmake/truemake) and only profiles those
functions which include a balanced pair of calls<p>

<pre>
chronoStart("Function name") ; chronoReturn() ;
</pre>

To use, open Chronometer from the main menu and pick
<strong>Start</strong> from the chrono menu.<p>

Then do whatever you want, i.e. parse a file, maybe intersperse your
work with other commands.  Select <strong>Stop</strong> from the
chrono menu when you are done, then pick <strong>Show</strong>.<p>

<strong>Print</strong> will copy the content of the chrono window to
./PS/chronometer#.PS or simply ./chronometer#.PS if you do not have a
PS subdirectory in your current directory.<p>

The output is in PostScript.<p>
