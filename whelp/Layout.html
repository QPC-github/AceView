The layout.wrm file is a simple, optional configuration file for AceDB which resides in the wspec directory and allows the database curator or
user to change the order and layout of the items appearing on the opening class menu window of xace.<p> 

In this respect, it supplants the -V and -H options of the options.wrm file and gives more flexibility to the layout of the window. The list of
classes on the menu is no longer rigidly restricted to a pattern of three evenly spaced columns. Using layout.wrm, the classes on the menu can be
displayed in any number of columns (if in columns at all) and spaced out using blank lines or extra whitespace to emphasise groupings of related
classes. It also allows subclasses to be placed anywhere on the menu (whereas previously they were placed at the end of the list of classes).<p> 

Upon executing, xace simply replicates the pattern (including whitespace characters and blank lines) shown in layout.wrm character by character
on the class window.
