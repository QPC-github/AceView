This help page provides basic information for the whole program.
For specific help on the Main Window press the "Page Down" button.

Exit:
  To exit the program choose Quit from the menu in the main window.

Help:
  The F1 or F10 or Help key invokes the on line help related to the
  window to which the mouse points.  Some of these keys may not work on
  some machines or under some window managers, but one should!
  There is also a help entry in most menus.

Printing:
  The F2 or F9 key creates a post-script file in the
  subdirectory PS of $ACEDB.  It will then try to print it using 
  "lpr".  If the environment variable ACEDB_LPR is set (e.g. 
  setenv ACEDB_LPR "lpr -Pmyprinter"),  then that print command is
  used instead.  Setting it to an empty string will prevent
  automatic printing.  There is also a print option in most menus.

Color, Gray, Black and White screens:
  In principle, under X11, acedb will autodetect the type of screen
  you are using. In case of problem, you can try to setenv one of
  ACEDB_MONO, ACEDB_GREY, ACEDB_GRAY, ACEDB_COLOR, ACEDB_COLOUR.

Mouse:
  The left button is used to pick windows or objects. Usually, picking
  once changes the color of the box, picking a second time initiates
  and action.
  The mid button is used in some graphic windows to recenter (single
  click) or to zoom and recenter (by dragging in horizontal and
  vertical directions). On the Next, press both buttons to emulate
  the mid button. 
  The right button is used to access menus.

Menu:
  Under X windows (Openwin) you get the menu for any acedb window by
  pressing the right mouse button when the cursor is in the window.
  Under SunView you must press the right mouse button when the
  cursor is in the title bar of the window.

Text entry boxes:
  The yellow and green boxes are micro text editors. Only one of
  them is active (yellow) in a given window. To activate one, pick
  it with the left mouse button, this will position the cursor.
  Recognised commands are: Return key, Insert key (a toggle), Delete
  and BackSpace keys, Home and End key, the left and right arrows,
  a set of usual control keys to move (^f: forward, ^b: backward,
  ^a: to beginning, ^e: to end of line) and delete (^d: a char, ^w:
  a word, ^k: to end of line, ^u: whole line) and Tab which
  autocompletes the names when the class is known.
