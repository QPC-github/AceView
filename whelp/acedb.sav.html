<h3>Main window </h3> 


  




   <strong>The Main Window</strong> lets you define the object you wish to find in the database in several ways. Holding the right button opens the <strong>command menu,</strong> and gives access  to other applications and functions of ACEDB, many of which have their own help. With the left-mouse button you can pick a class and search pattern  in the main window:<p>
<ul>

<li>The <a href="box.html">Search box</a> will look for your object in a given <a href="class.html">Class</a>. You select your class with the left mouse button and the black triangle gives access to other than everyday classes.  A double-click on a class calls up the <A HREF="KeySet.html">Main KeySet</a>, and displays the objects in that class for your selection: just double-click on the one you want and a new window which might contain  <A HREF="Tree.html">text</a> or be a special display, like a <A HREF="Genetic-map.html">genetic map</a> will open. Since you may have a lot of objects in a given class, you might want to use the yellow <a href="box.html">Search box</a> to restrict this list.




<li> The <strong>Global Search box</strong>will find all the objects in the database
that  <strong>contain</strong> the search string in their name, but also all those that  <strong> refer</strong> to it. You don't have to select a class, since this will search every class in the database.

<li> The <strong>Long Search</strong> will find all the objects in the database
that  <strong>contain</strong> the search string in their name, references, or body. It was developped to find for example all the abstracts containing a specific  word.



</ul>
