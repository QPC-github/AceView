<h2>Setting up a print buffer</h2>

 The<strong>F2 or F9 key</strong> creates a post-script
file in the subdirectory PS of $ACEDB.  It will then try to print it
using "lpr".  If the environment variable ACEDB_LPR is set (e.g.
setenv ACEDB_LPR "lpr -Pmyprinter"), then that print command is used
instead.  Setting it to an empty string will prevent automatic
printing.
