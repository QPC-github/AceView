<h2>Dump</h2>

Dumps the whole data base into an ace file.<p>

The dump file can be edited by hand, parsed back in an empty system
(provided you split out the copy of the tags and classes files) or use
with acediff to compare 2 sessions.<p>

At the same time, Dump checks the integrity of the whole database and
verifies the existence of all the XREF's.<p>

Dump dumps all the Visible A and B (not X) classes. This information is
sufficient for a complete reconstruction.<p>
