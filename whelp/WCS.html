<h2>WCS</h2>

WCS is the Worm Community System of Schatz et al. (Arizona).
E-mail schatz@cs.arizona.edu to get further info on WCS.<p>

To access WCS from ACEDB, you must run under X-windows, and start both
ACEDB and WCS. Whenever the 2 programs run on the same X server
(i.e. your terminal), even if from different clients (for example
acedb running in Cambridge and WCS in Arizona, your terminal being in
New York) the main ACEDB menu changes and you get 3 more entries as
follows:<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>WCS Annotate</strong>: Sends an annotation to WCS.

<li><strong>WCS Show</strong>: Asks WCS for an eventual annotation.

<li><strong>WCS Search</strong>: Use an object name as a search string
in WCS.

</ul>
