//  This file should have the same permissions as the rest of the database
//  and be accessible for writing only by the acedb server program accessing
//  the program and by the database administrator.

//  Format:

//  users should be one per line with the encrypted form of their
//  password following as a separate 'word' on that line, there must be
//  _NO_ white space in front of the userid, it must be at the beginning of
//  the line.

//  All users names should also be in one of the three groups admin, write or read.
//  Unless the users name can be found in one of the groups in this file they will
//  not be able to log on. The format of a 'group' line is the group name followed

//  
//  admin: user1 user2 user3
