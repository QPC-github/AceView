#About the new SECQ_NB file deposited on sas August 28, 2012. The first paragraphs need to be edited for each project.
#This table includes 55,789 AceView genes (annotated at NCBI www.aceview.org), one gene per row. 23,324 of these genes are ‘official' Entrez genes, with RefSeq annotated transcripts, the other 32,465 are annotated in AceView only, and they have no official Entrez gene and no RefSeq. AceView genes are complemented by 6,219 RefSeq genes, which were not represented in AceView2010, or are fused with another gene in AceView. Expression indexes for each gene in each run are shown in the successive columns; then come the average expression of groups of runs. In particular, gene expression for the 15 NB individuals with duplicate runs was computed by adding the reads from the two runs, the resulting index is found among the groups, to the right of the table (NB248, 251, 252-258, 493-498). For questions other than technical quality control, please use these 15 group columns and remove the corresponding 30 runs (same title NB# followed by a or b), so as not to count these individuals twice. The last 10 columns give the expression profile for groups of individuals, with self-explanatory names (e.g. Favorable_TrainingSet_87 individuals). 
#The genes are sorted by descending index of expression, taking for each gene its maximal index across the 513 NB runs. To sort using the sum across all runs of all reads mapping in the genes, reorder on  the first numerical column, called "SumOfAllReadsInProject". To reorder the genes using the average index of the gene across the 498 NB samples, reorder on the last column", 'Neuroblastoma_498indiv'. Note that a number of genes in this table are 'not expressed'/NA in all NB runs (3,568 RefSeq genes and 4,909 AceView genes).
# Choice of genes: AceView 2010 genes integrate and summarize all human cDNA sequences in GenBank, dbEST and RefSeq NM/NR transcript models. AceView genes include all Entrez genes from 2010, and Entrez gene names are used when available, otherwise genes are named an AceView identifier, stable across releases. cDNA sequences in GenBank define about twice as many genes and close to twice as many exon junctions (370,000 rather than 198,000). AceView annotates 200,000 spliced transcript variants, that is 7 times more alternatively spliced variants than in RefSeq.  
# For each gene (named in column 1), in a given annotation (column 2), the NCBI GeneID is provided (Column 3). Note that genes not officially annotated do not have a geneID, and some AceView genes where cDNA sequences in GenBank merged and connected two nearby genes have 2 or more GeneIDs. The RefSeq transcript ID(s) are given in column 4 (from Aug 28, 2012 Gene2RefSeq file at NCBI). Then to allow comparison to microarray datasets, the Agilent probes ID we uniquely re-mapped to the gene in column 1 is provided in column 5 (34,374 probes map to 23,720 genes). Col 6 to 9 give the chromosome, strand, and start and end coordinates of the AceView genes on the genome. Col 10 gives the descriptive gene title, from AceView, and col 11 summarizes the object measured (gene name and annotation of origin). The following columns are the index of expression, per run then per group.
# Mapping strategy:  We use our RNAseq aligner and pipeline, called Magic. The read pairs were mapped in parallel on the AceView 2010 transcripts, the RefSeq 2012, the genome, the mitochondria, the ribosomal RNAs, and the ERCC and PhiX controls. Alignments on the genome can be discontinuous, allowing for exon-junctions discovery. Alignments may include substitutions, short insertions or deletions. The eventual adaptor sequences and poly A tails are trimmed dynamically during the alignment, verifying  that the trimmed part does not match the target genome or gene. Finally, the best targets for each read-pair are  selected, and only reads mapping well and at their best score in the AceView transcripts are used to compute the gene indexes in this table. Genes often have alternative transcripts, to which the reads map equally well; such reads count as uniquely mapped in the gene, and each gene receives the union (not the sum) of all reads mapping to its alternative transcripts. Reads mapping equally well in up to 9 genes are attributed to the candidate genes in Bayesian proportion of the number of reads mapping uniquely to these genes (a similar table limited to uniquely mapping reads, is available on request).
# The Magic expression index for the gene is measured as the log base 2 of the number of bases aligned in the gene, divided by the number of terabases aligned in known genes and by the length of the gene, with several corrections. When a gene is reliably measured (i.e. not NA), the index is independent of the size of the experiment, and it factors in the quality of the libraries, the insert length and the noise level. The noise is mainly genomic contamination, evaluated as the fraction of truly intergenic reads after transcriptome reconstruction. Our index is directly comparable to a normalized microarray logarithmic luminosity. 
# Genes that are not "significantly expressed", i.e. with less than 4 reads above the experimental noise level, acquire an NA/ flag. As of August 28, 2012, since some programs do not know how to deal with absent values (e.g. some DEG identifiers), a value is now given behind the NA/ as a hint of the unreliably measured index, based on too few counts to be accurate and dominated by sampling errors. To treat NA, there are three options: one may either blank out the absent values, or take the hint value behind NA (not too seriously), or use a common value for NA in each run, for instance the number given in the first numerical line of the table, "#Lowest measurable index", minus 1 (Thanks to David Kreil, Peter and Pawel from Boku for testing the three methods). 
# For significantly expressed genes, the expression index is measured as Index = log2 (z+ sqrt(1+z^2))-1, with z = 10^12 n/N'l'
# z estimates the coverage of the gene per terabases aligned,  n is the number of bases aligned in the gene,  N' /10^12 is the corrected number of terabases aligned to the AceView genes with GeneID, after excluding the ribosomal and mitochondrial genes and the genes gathering more than 2% of the total number of bases aligned, to compensate an apparent variation of all indexes in the presence of highly-variable extremely-expressed genes.  l' is the length of the gene effectively sequenceable in the particular experiment, which is limited in polyA selected libraries by the maximal length of the cDNA synthesis, and constrained by the insert length: genes shorter than insert size cannot be sequenced. In practice, the coverage of very long ubiquitous genes (such as EEF2 (3.5kb), FLNA (8.5 kb), MALAT1 (7kb), AHNAK (18 kb) or NEAT (22 kb)) is measured and used as a maximal gene length. This length is usually below 3 kb for a polyA selection protocol; it corresponds mainly to the 3' bias. Second, the average length lambda of the insert is measured by aligning the read pairs, and subtracted from the length of the main RNA l. Indeed l'= (l – lambda) is the number of possible positions of the insert in the gene; l' is set to at least lambda. This correction matters for short genes, under-represented in libraries with long insert size.
