<H1>Application programmers' guide to the messubs utilities</H1>

<PRE>

There are several ancient and/or basic utility packages bundled into
regular.h.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



                Message system
		--------------

messubs contains basic routines for message handling, crash control,
memory management.  One aim was to localise all the *printf() type
functions in messubs.  The more general form is in w1/messubs.c.  In a
small application without the graph package use messclean.c, which
#define's MESSCLEAN and then includes messubs.c.

	void messout (char *format,...)

displays a blocking message on the screen using graphOut().  If there
is no graph package it prints to stderr.  If the dump file is already
open it also writes the message to the dump file via messdump().

	void messdump (char *format,...)

appends the message to the dump file, which is by default "logbook.wrm".


	void messerror (char *format,...)
	& void messSysError (char *format,...)

related to perror().  Forces a crash via messcrash() after 50 calls.
Use messerror when there has been an acedb error unrelated to any system
call, use messSysError when a system call failed and errno will be
used to return information about the reason for the system call failure.

	void messcrash (char *format,...)
	& void messSysCrash (char *format,...)

writes out the user supplied message, then calls
invokedebugger(), then tries to call any cleanup routine that has been
registered via crashroutine().  This process is not reentrant.  Any
subsequent call to messcrash() leads to an immediate exit().
Use messcrash if there was an acedb error unrelated to any system call,
use messSysCrash when a system call failed and errno will be
used to return information about the reason for the system call failure.


	VoidRoutine crashroutine (VoidRoutine cleanup)

registers cleanup() to be called during a crash by messcrash().

	char *messprintf (char *format,...)

sprintf into (static!) buffer - returns the buffer.

	void messdumpset (char *cp)

sets the dumpfile name if called before the first call to messdump().

	void messbeep (void) 	- issues a beep

---------------------------------------------------------------------------




                Free Store system
		-----------------

All dynamic memory allocation should be done via this package.  Note
that it is not permissable to call messfree() in the result of a call
to malloc(), or free() on the results of a messalloc().

	char *messalloc (int size)

is analogous to malloc() with a messcrash() if it fails.  However
there is some extra overhead in both memory and time, so repeated
messalloc/messfree calls on many small items should be avoided.

	BOOL messfree (char *cp)

is a macro which does the equivalent of free() on cp if non-null,
followed by setting cp = 0 and returning TRUE, else if cp == 0,
returns FALSE.  If the block pointed to by cp has a finalisation
routine, it is called just before the memory is deallocated. (See
below.)

There is a handle-based free store package which allows easy and painless
de-allocation of complex structures.


	STORE_HANDLE handleCreate (void)

returns a new store handle, which can be passed to halloc() to
register store on that handle.


	char *halloc (int size, STORE_HANDLE handle)

Gets size bytes, as malloc, but registers the memory block on handle,
The store can be deallocated by calling messfree(), as usual, or by
calling handleDestroy() with its handle.  Handle can be zero, in which
case this call is identical to calling messfree.


	void handleDestroy (STORE_HANDLE handle)

deallocates all the store registered on handle, calling all the
finalisation routines for the blocks, if they exist. The order of
deallocation is not specified. The handle stucture is also
deallocated, and handle becomes invalid.


	void blockSetFinalise(char *block, void (*final)(char *)

Registers a finalisation a finalisation routine on block, which must
have been allocated by either messalloc or halloc. When the block gets
freed, either by messfree or handleDestroy, the finalisation routine
is called with the address of the block, just before it is freed. It
is acceptable to call blockSetFinalize multiple times on the same
block, later finalisation routines overwrite earlier ones. Zero is an
acceptable argument and cancels finalisation.


	Void handleSetFinalise(STORE_HANDLE handle, 
			       void (*final)(char *),
			       char *arg)

Registers a finalisation routine on a handle, it gets called when
handleDestroy is called, with argument arg, before any of the blocks
on the handle are freed, or their finalisation routines are called.
Again, may be called multiply, and with zero for final.
 

Note that there are analogous stackHandleCreate and arrayHandleCreate
routines which register the Arrays and Stacks they create on a handle,
to be automatically destroyed by a call to handleDestroy(). It is
permissable to mix memory blocks, Arrays, and Stacks on the same
handle.


	void handleInfo (STORE_HANDLE handle, int *number, int *size) ;

Will return (in number) the number of memory blocks allocated on a
handle and (in size) their total size in bytes.  Note that
Arrays and Stacks allocated on a handle do not allocate all their
memory on the handle, so the information returned by this function on
handles which have Arrays and Stacks on them may be misleading.


	STORE_HANDLE handleHandleCreate(STORE_HANDLE parent_handle) ;

ADVANCED USERS ONLY. handleHandleCreate does the same as handleCreate,
except that the handle returned is itself registered on the handle 
passed as argument. All store allocated on the new handle can be 
freed as usual by calling handleDestroy on it; but in addition if 
parent_handle is freed by a call to handleDestroy, all the store
registered on the new handle will be freed as a consequence of the freeing 
of the new handle. This facility is useful for grouping a set of data
structures which may be deallocated either as a group, or as a consequence of
the deallocation of their parent. Note that so far as calling handleInfo 
on parent_handle is concerned, the new handle represents a single object of
a few tens of bytes. Any memory held on the new handle is not reported.


	char *strnew(char *old, STORE_HANDLE handle)

Is a useful utility function, It allocates a suitably sized block on
the handle, and copies the string pointed to by old into it, reurning
the address of the copy.


	void handleAlloc(STORE_HANDLE handle, 
			 void (*final)(char *),
			 int size)

Is deprecated, (it was the original interface) simply calls halloc,
followed by blockSetFinalize. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

filsubs
-------

	char *filsetdir (char *s)

Sets *s as the standard root path for all subsequent file commands.
Used once in ACEDB to set $ACEDB.  Returns the old value.  If s == 0
then doesn't change the path, and returns the current value (the most
common use of the function). 

	FILE *filopen (char *name, char *ending, char *spec)

Opens the file with given name.  If the name does not start with '/'
or '.' then the standard root path set in filsetdir() is prepended.
If ending and *ending then '.' ending is postpended.  Calls
messerror() if the file can not be opened.

	FILE *filmail (char *address)

Can be used in place of filopen() to open a file that will be mailed
to the given address when it is closed (using filclose()).

	void filclose (FILE* fil)

Closes a file.  Mails it if it was opened with filmail().  Always use
filclose(), since a file may have been opened using filmail().

	FILE *filqueryopen (char *dirname, char *filname,
			    char *ending, char *spec, char *title) ;

This presents an interactive file chooser for the user to open a file.
The user can always cancel, so you must check the return value.  Only
directories and files with the given "ending" will be presented to the
user.  title is the title of the file chooser window, which can help
suggest what the file is for.  dirname and filname should either be 0,
in which case defaults are used, or static character arrays of 48 and
24 characters respectively.  In this case, the directory and name of
the opened file will be left in the arrays, first allowing the
programmer to get at the file names, and second establishing a default
for the next time that the function is called.  If spec is "w" one of
the options from the chooser is allow the user to specify a mail
address and open the file using filmail(), so you must be sure to
close files opened by filqueryopen() with filclose().

	BOOL filexists (char *name, char *ending)

Tests for existence of a file, using the same rules for root and
ending as filopen().

	BOOL filremove (char *name, char *ending)

Deletes a file from the operating system, using the same rules for
root and ending as filopen().

	FILE *filtmpopen (char **nameptr, char *spec)
	BOOL filtmpremove (char *name)
	void filtmpcleanup (void)

filtmpopen() opens a temporary file.  The name is returned to you in
*nameptr.  You can reopen the same file by leaving *nameptr and
setting spec to "r".  Use filtmpremove(*nameptr) to delete the file
when finished.  This will free memory for the file name -- DO NOT
messfree (*nameptr).  If you do not free explicitly filtmpremove() the
temporary file, it will be removed automatically at the end of your
ACEDB session (by filtmpcleanup()), unless of course you crash.
