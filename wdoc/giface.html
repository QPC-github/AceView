Notes on giface
===============

From the user's point of view, giface is a version of tace with
extensions to generate gif and map files corresponding for acedb
displays.  (From the programmer's point of view, it links in all the
application code, so in fact is more like xace, but with gif as its
graphics output mode.)

Currently it can only dump Map displays, but it is not hard to add
others, and I expect at least Sequence to be added soon.

You run giface just like tace, with the database directory as a
command line argument, or set as the ACEDB environment variable.
There is a new single new command added to the standard tace menu,
"gif".  This opens up a separate menu, with prompt "acedb-gif> ".  In
this menu you can issue the following commands:

Commands
========

dimensions x y : in pixels
--------------------------
This sets the dimensions in pixels of the gif image you will create.

map name map view [x1 x2] : writes to name.gif and name.boxes
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is the command that does the work.  You specify a Unix file path
as "name", then the map object, the view object you want to use, and
optionally a start and end point in the coordinates of the map object.
It will draw a gif containing exactly what you would see on the screen
(except perhaps for bizarre font choices), and also produce a file
with ending .boxes that contains information on where all the
clickable objects are, and what they contain.  The format of the boxes
file is given below.

quit
----
This returns to the standard tace menu.

You can issue any series of dimension and map commands, creating many
gifs from one session of giface.

.boxes file format
==================

A set of lines:

boxnum x1 y1 x2 y2 class:"name" < class:"name" | display_type

The boxnum is probably irrelevant to external people.  x1,y1,x2,y2 are
the bounding box coordinates.  The first 'class:"name"' specifies the
object in the box.  The second specifies the object from which this is
obtained, in most cases here the Map, and the display_type is a hint
as to how to display it, probably normally 'TREE', i.e. the standard
text display.  For external web use, the 'x1 y1 x2 y2 class:"name"'
section is probably all that is relevant.

Example
=======

Here is a sample session:

unix-prompt: giface ~wormpub/acedb/ace4/cgc
acedb> gif
acedb-gif> dim 250 800
acedb-gif> map /nfs/disk37/rd/tmp/III-1 Sequence-III MAP-default -40 -2
acedb-gif> map /nfs/disk37/rd/tmp/III-2 Sequence-III MAP-default -5 5
...
acedb-gif> quit
// 0 Active Objects 
acedb> quit

 A bientot 

unix-prompt: 

  The resulting .boxes file contains lines like

12   61 83 69 121    Rearrangement:"sDp3" < Map:"III" | TREE
13   69 83 77 785    Rearrangement:"mnDp37" < Map:"III" | TREE
