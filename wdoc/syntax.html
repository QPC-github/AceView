<h2>Abstract</h2>

ACEDB is an object-oriented database management system that we have
developed for scientific research projects where many data are very
incomplete.  The aim of this technical report is to give the formal
syntactic definition of the schema of an ACEDB database, of the
associated query language and of the update file
mechanism. Corresponding syntactic validation tools are available on
request.<p>

<h2>The ACEDB Data Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

A thorough description of the ACEDB semantics will be found in
[Durbin, Thierry-Mieg, 1993]. In this section we just hope to clarify,
using a simple example, the meaning of the 3 BNF grammars described in
this technical document.<p>

Figure 1 shows a simple ACEDB schema consisting of four models, three
for classes and one for a constructed type.<p>

Data are organised into objects and classes. Each object belongs to
exactly one class and has an externally visible name which is unique
within that class. Each class and constructed type is identified by
its externally visible model name, which is unique within the
schema.<p>
 
A model is presented as a tree [Figure 1].  It contains five types of
node: <strong>tags</strong> (e.g.  <var> Title, French</var>), which
are words that must be enumerated in a separate file, basic data types
(<var> Int, Float, Text</var>), modifiers (<var> XREF, UNIQUE,
REPEAT</var>), class names (e.g.  <var> ?Author</var>) and constructed
type names (e.g. <var> #Address</var>).  The tags must form a rooted
subtree of the model and can appear only once in a model (except those
following XREF).  Note that tags may appear as leaves in the tree.
This implements in a natural way Boolean flags, via the presence or
absence of a tag, and restricted vocabularies, as following Language
in model Paper.<p>

                Example of ACEDB objects\label
</pre>

An instance of a class, i.e. an object belonging to that class, is
also presented as a tree [Figure 2]. It contains tags, data items and
pointers to other objects.  The object must match the model for
its class: tags must appear in corresponding positions, data items must
be of the type specified by the model, and pointers must refer to
objects of the class specified by the model.  Hence, ACEDB is a
strongly typed system. However, the -C construction allows to add
anywhere in the objects free comments that will be visible to the
human users but will not, in any way, affect the behaviour of
client programs relying on the database server.<p>

The single most important feature of the ACEDB design is that an
object need only match a rooted subtree of its model; any branch in an
object can legally be pruned off.  This allows one to extend the
schema without touching the objects and implies that small partially
specified objects cost little memory.<p>

UNIQUE can follow any non-leaf node in a model.  If present, the
matching node in an object will be followed immediately to its right
by at most one node chosen from among those allowed by the model at
that position.  This implements exclusive choice between branches
(e.g.  after Language or Reference in class paper) and unicity of
pointers or data items (e.g. after Title or Journal). By default, a
data or class type in the model allows a non repetitive set of nodes
of the given type, displayed in a vertical column (e.g after Author in
Paper acePaper).<p>

XREF establishes automatic cross-referencing between objects. It must
follow a pointer and be followed by a tag name, which tells the system
where to create or remove the back pointer.  Note however that XREF
acts in only one direction and does not propagate; both XREF's should
be stated if one wants to guarantee the existence of the double link.
This is quite versatile as shown in the last 2 lines of Class Author.<p>

REPEAT must follow a data or pointer node and must end a branch. It
allows in the object the existence of an arbitrary tree of nodes of
the given type (e.g. phone numbers in object Thierry-Mieg).  In the same
conditions UNIQUE REPEAT forbids branching and hence just allows an
ordered list of nodes with possible repetitions.<p>

Constructed types allow a recursive specification of data within a
model (e.g.  #Paper in ?Paper). The #Type node in the model is not
represented by a node in the object but simply switches at that point
the matching rule to the root of the included model.
#Type is always UNIQUE and cannot be REPEAT.<p>

Finally, in addition to the classes defined using models, ACEDB allows
the existence of Array classes, which are simply treated by the
database manager as binary buffers.  Such classes can appear in
models, since pointers to them can exist, but they do not support XREF
clauses.  It is up to the application to deal with the content of the
buffer.  The standard ACEDB implementation defines LongText and DNA
Array classes, optimised for text and DNA sequence storage.<p>

          ;
&lt;tag column&gt; ::= &lt;tag node&gt;

                       and containing letters, digits and `_' */
</pre>

<h3>Preprocessor</h3>

There is a preprocessor ran before parsing the models. it takes
the following actions.<p>

<blockquote>
A double slash "//" is considered as the beginning of a comment
and input is skipped until the end of the line.<p>

Tabs are reinterpreted as rounding to 8 spaces.<p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Additional Rules</h3>


<blockquote>
A tag name must be unique within a model.<p>

An ACEDB model is defined as a hierarchical tree.  Items at the
same level in the hierarchy must be identically indented on
consecutive lines. This is indicated in the BNF grammar by indentation
(<var> START_INDENT</var> and <var> END_INDENT</var>), and new line
separators (<var> NL</var>).<p>

If "?C XREF T", appears in a &lt; class reference &gt; clause in
model M, then "T ?M" must appear in the model for class C. XREF
clauses included recursively within a constructed subtype are ignored.<p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The ACEDB Query Language</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Acedb is object oriented. In contradistinction with relational
databases like Oracle or Sybase, each data item is addressed by name
rather than by content. This precludes a direct implementation of
the standard relation oriented query language SQL. Rather, the
central operation is to construct sets of objects with desirable
properties, to combine and to filter these sets and to follow the
pointers to neighbouring objects as in the following example:<p>

<pre>
     samPapers := {Find Paper Author = Sam } ;
     { Find Journal Proceedings* ; Follow paper }
           AND $samPapers ;
      Year >= 1992 ;
</pre>

In the first line, we construct the set of all papers known in the
database such that Sam is one of the authors, and name this set <var>
samPapers</var>. In the second line, we search for journals named
"Proceedings of something or other" and then obtain all the papers
published in those journals. In the third line, we intersect this
unnamed set with the former. The resulting intersection is then piped
to the fourth line and filtered on the year of publication.<p>

Obviously, there are many equivalent ways to express the same query.
Given the automatic cross-referencing between Journal and Paper
expresed in figure 1, we could have asked directly:<p>

<pre>
   Find Paper 
     Author = Sam AND Journal = Proceedings* AND Year >= 1992 ;
</pre>


<h3>Target Set</h3>

Apart from the usual nightmare of learning yet another language,
with its peculiar punctuation and symbols, the only difficulty is to
understand properly which data are screened against which part of
the query.<p>

The first operation is to select a target set. a) One can start from
a whole class, as in "Find Paper". b) One can select a previous
set by picking it on screen with the mouse or by the clause "From
samPapers". c) One may follow pointers as in "Follow Paper" which
will create the set of all objects following the tag Paper in
objects of the active keyset. d) One may rely on the semicolon to
pipe the result of the previous query as the default target of the
next query. Hence "From samPapers &amp lt; condition &amp gt; ;" is equivalent
to the double query "$samPapers ; &lt; condition &gt; ;".<p>

If a query is of the form &lt; set operators &gt;, each &lt; set &gt;
is entered with the same default target.<p>

The scope of the set names is limited to a session or a command
file.<p>

<h3>Active object and node</h3>

Given a target set, the &lt; condition &gt; clause is applied in turn to
each object in the set.  This "active object" is kept if the
condition is satisfied, discarded otherwise. A cursor, defining the
"active node", is attached to the active object, initially at the
root, and a twin cursor points to the root of the corresponding
model. Each succesful &lt; locator &gt; clause will then move these
cursors. A &lt; tag &gt; will move to the tag, if present in the object.
NEXT will move once right. HERE will stay on the same node. A
&lt; locator &gt; &lt; comparator &gt; &lt; string &gt; will move the cursor to
the column right of the locator, and then, within that column, to the
first node matching the comparison. It is important to realise that
&lt; locators &gt; are evaluated by order of precedence of the operators
linking them, and only as far as required to evaluate the boolean
expression, as in C language. Thus, "A OR B OR C" will leave the
cursor on the first tag among A,B, and C present in the object. "A =
*" and "A AND NEXT" are equivalent clauses which leave the cursor
on the node right of tag A and return TRUE if present, or else return
FALSE.<p>

<h3>Atomic conditions</h3>

The rest of the syntax is straightforward. Elementary conditions
return TRUE or FALSE and are combined by the usual operators NOT, AND,
XOR, OR. Subexpressions can be paranthesised. CLASS and IS refer to
the class and name of the active object and must be followed by a
comparator and a string. As a short hand, IS as the first operator of
a &lt; condition &gt; can be omitted at the user's risk, provided the
string is not misinterpreted as a tag name by the system.  Also "="
may be dropped following IS.  e.g. "IS &lt; string2 &gt;" is
accepted as shorthand for "IS = &lt; string2 &gt;".<p>


&lt; strings &gt; can contain wildcard characters (`*' for any text,
`?' for a single character). For example, a*ba* will match strings
starting with `a' aand containing `ba'. We may in the future allow
more general Unix style regular expressions.<p>

&lt; locator &gt; is a Boolean check on the existence of a node. <p>

Finally, the # symbol evaluates to TRUE if both its left and right
hand sides  do. The difference with AND is that # jumps
the implicit model cursor, and hence the matching process, into a
constructed type (which must be present at that point in the model),
without moving the cursor in the active object. Recall that no node
in the object corresponds to the #type node of the model.<p>

<h3>Command files</h3>

In place of a simple query, it is possible to invoke a command file
that contains query text (which might possibly include further
recursive invocations of command files).  Any strings after the
command file name will be used as parameters, substituting for %1,
%2, %3 etc. in the command file text.  This is done by macro
string substitution. Named sets are inherited in the included
command, without possible conflict with those declared locally.<p> 

<h3>Extraction of data</h3>

The system described in this section allows one to select objects, but
not to extract numerical data. This operation can be performed in
ACEDB, either in interactive or in batch mode, by using a facility
called the table maker which essentially constructs a spreadsheet-like
table. However, this facility has been introduced only recently and is
still evolving, so it is too early to give its formal definition.<p>

</pre>




<h3>Preprocessor</h3>

There is a preprocessor ran before parsing the queries. it takes
the following actions.<p>

<blockquote>

A double slash "//" is considered as the beginning of a comment
and input is skipped until the end of the line.<p>

The backslash can be used to escape a backslash, a  double
quote or a newline. <p>

Tabs are reinterpreted as rounding to 8 spaces.<p>

Spaces inside names must be protected by double quotes, but to
prevent runaway, a new line ends an ongoing open double quote.<p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Additional Rules</h3>

<blockquote>

&lt; comparators &gt; try to evaluate their operands as numbers and
if they cannot fall back on comparing strings of characters. However
ACEDB does not use strict alphabetic ordering. It recognises embeded
integers and will order <var> a3x</var> left of <var> a25x</var>.<p>

The &lt; condition &gt; is evaluated in succession on each object of
the &lt; target set &gt;. When the condition is entered a cursor is
set at the root of the object. This implicit cursor will then move
with each successful &lt; locator &gt; clause. A &lt; locator &gt;
&lt; comparator &gt; &lt; string &gt; clause will move the cursor if
possible to the right of the locator and then down the column onto the
first node satisfying the comparator or to the end of that
column. This position can then be used as the start of the next
search.<p>


</blockquote>

<h3>Description</h3>

The ace file update language is used to import and export data as
ascii text files. The following properties make it versatile and
powerful.<p>
<blockquote>

Entries are based on records (lines) and paragraphs (groups of
lines separated by blank lines).<p>

Each paragraph starts with a class name and object name, and
corresponds to a set of actions on that object.<p>

Each subsequent line in a paragraph starts with a tag name and
defines, according to the model, a path in the object to a single
node.  Any parts of the branch up to the node not yet present in the
object will be created.<p>

In addition to simply specifying data, simple directives at the
beginning of lines allow deletion of data, renaming of objects, and
establishment of aliases.  Altogether this allows the propagation of
any transformation of one database to a remote site.<p>
</blockquote>

Hence, in contrast to ASN-1 files, ace files are easy to read and
hand edit and are highly compatible with the standard line oriented
Unix commands. Furthermore, it is extremely easy to export data from
one ace database and import part of these into another ace database
with a rather different schema. One just has to delete or comment
out with a ! those classes and tags unknown to the second schema.
The fields common to the two schemas will then be read by the
receiving ACEDB.<p>

Property (c) relies on the construction of ACEDB models, which
permits unambiguous addressing of each node of an object using an
abbreviated path from the root.  Because tags are unique in a model,
"interior" tags, i.e. tags that are followed by another tag, are
not required.<p>

In figure 4, we give an ace file sufficient to reconstruct the objects
of figure 2.<p>

<h3>Preprocessor</h3>

There is a preprocessor ran before parsing the ace files. it takes
the following actions.<p>

<blockquote>

Paragraph starting with "!" are skipped.<p>

Lines starting with "!" are skipped.<p>

A double slash "//" is considered as the beginning of a comment
and input is skipped until the end of the line.<p>

The backslash can be used to escape a backslash, a  double
quote or a newline. In the case of a newline all space and tabs at the
beginning of the next line are also skipped. Therefore, one often
wants to break a long line as follows:<p>

<pre>
  here is some text from a very long line.  There will be only \
  one space between "only" and "one".
</pre>

Other files can be included recursively by the command @fileName, with
@ the first character on a line.<p>

Tabs are reinterpreted as 8 spaces.

Spaces inside names must be protected by double quotes, but to prevent
runaway, a new line ends an ongoing open double quote.  Furthermore,
ACEDB will remove leading and trailing spaces from names even if the
are protected by a double quotes.<p>

</blockquote>


<h3>Additional Rules</h3>

&lt; path &gt; and &lt; data list &gt; are interpreted according to
the model, and must conform.  In particular, if the model specifies a
class, a &lt; datum &gt; will be interpreted as the name of an object
in that class, and this object will silently be created if it does not
already exist.  If the model specifies Float or Int &lt; datum &gt;
will be interpreted as a numerical value if possible, else a parse
error will be generated.  If the model specifies Text then the &lt;
datum &gt; will be entered as a string.  There is also a parse error
if a tag is given that can not be found in the currently relevant
model.<p>

In case of a parsing error, the whole paragraph is discarded with a
warning message.<p>

It is not an error if a -Delete, -Alias or -Rename clause does not
find its target. This property ensures that the same ace file can be
read twice without error (which is very useful).<p>
