Copy-on-write databases
---

A copy-on-write database looks just like a regular acedb database,
but it uses read-only data files from some older database.  When
it needs to write to a data file, it copies that file into it's own
space and then writes to the new copy.

w5/cowdb is a script that helps you set up a copy-on-write database.

The set of files needed is nearly identical.  The significant changes
are

- you need a COW line in wspec/database.wrm that specifies the name
of the directory where the old data files are found.  For example,
	COW /net/annie/export/home/mieg/worm/database
The database will look in this directory for old data files.

- you do not initialize the database.  The data files are copied
from the old database as needed.

The assumption is that the old database is static.  If someone is
making updates in the old database, their changes may eventually
result in inconsistencies that make your new database malfunction.

You cannot have a copy-on-write database refer to another copy-on-write
database for it's data, but you can make a single directory and
fill it with symlinks that point at the right data files.
