List of distribution files
==========================

  README	brief list of files
  NOTES		this file
  INSTALL	first time installation script

in ace4/
  bin.sunos.n_k	SUN Sparc executables for SunOS 4.1.3, run time files,
		documentation.
  bin.solaris.n_k Sun SPARC Solaris 2.2 and above.
  bin.alpha.n_k	DEC-alpha/OSF-1 executables, etc.
  bin.sgi.n_k	Silicon Graphics Irix executables, etc.
  bin.xxx.n_k   more ports are available (see wmake directory)
  source.n_k	the full source directories for remaking acedb, including
		documentation.
in celegans/
  README	general information on the worm data
  update.n-i	update files.  i will range from 1 to m, the current
		database minor version.

in doc/		various documentation files, in particular
		WRITE_ACCESS, which explains about how to manage write
		access for multiple users.


All files except NOTES, README and INSTALL are tar.Z files.  They will
be uncompressed and untarred automatically by the INSTALL script if
you are using it to install, which is recommended.

The letters n, k and i in the above refer to version numbers.  So
bin.sunos.4_1 has major version n=4 and minor version k=1.  The major
version, n, should agree for all the files that you are using.  The
minor versions for the program (source and bin) and for the data
(updates) are different.  update.n-i converts from database.n-(i-1) to
database.n-i.

		     ******* IMPORTANT ******* 

You should only need one of the files in ace4/, either bin... or
source...  It is simplest to take the correct bin...  to run on your
machine.  Then you should not need to recompile acedb.  You would only
need source... if you are going to recompile, e.g. for a computer type
not available in the distribution, or if you want to look at the code.

Current state of the system
===========================

The current release, is 4_3i.  It supports the C. elegans genomic
database.  So in the above n,k,m notation: n=4, k=3, m=16.

This new release 4_3 is fully compatible with 4_1 and 4_2.
It is much faster than 4_1 on large databases, many imporvements
and clears many bugs. The client server is fully operational, and the
text command language has been improved and rationalised. 

Thus, we strongly urge you to upgrade from 4_1 to 4_3.  Warning: 4_2,
which was only released in test, has a bad bug and, if used accross
architectures with different byte order (i.e. if you run a dec and a
sun binary on the same disk accross NFS) will corrupt ireversibly the
database.

There is a copyright notice in subdirectory wdoc that says that there
is absolutely no guarantee of any kind, and that we don't mind you
giving acedb away, but we don't want either you, or whoever you give
it to, to try to make money from it.

How to get the latest release
=============================

You are welcome to copy acedb from a friend, but if you have access to
internet then it may be best to get your own version to be sure it is
up to date.  The latest version of this program is available by ftp
from several public file servers.  In each case log in as user
"anonymous" and give a user identifier as password.

1) ncbi.nih.gov (130.14.20.1) in the USA, in repository/acedb
2) ftp.sanger.ac.uk in England, in pub/acedb
3) lirmm.lirmm.fr (193.49.104.10) in France, directory pub/acedb

Under each of these there should be directories ace4/, celegans/, doc/
as listed above.

An example session would be:
				# comments
ftp ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
login: anonymous
password: your user id or email address
cd repository/acedb             # change to relevant directoy
binary				# IMPORTANT
dir				# display files in this directory
get README
get NOTES
get INSTALL
cd ace4				# change to ace4 directory
get bin.sunos.4_1.tar.Z		# get program
cd ../celegans			# change to worm data directory
mget update*			# get all update files
quit

How to install acedb
====================

If installing for the first time, make a new home directory for acedb
and place all the .tar.Z files you need plus INSTALL into this
directory.  If you are installing the worm data, this should be on a
disk with 250Mb of free space.  If updating, put the extra files you
are adding, and a new copy of INSTALL, into your existing acedb home
directory.  The INSTALL script works correctly for both new
installations and when just installing the latest release.  In the
later case, it saves and restores the passwd file.  To run the INSTALL
script type:
	source INSTALL

In our default configuration the acedb database can only be updated by
the user who installed it.  If you want other people than the
installer to be able to edit acedb, please read the document
WRITE_ACCESS (in doc/).

IMPORTANT: DO NOT INSTALL AS ROOT: this would create a security loophole. 

Loading the C. elegans data
===========================

After installation, you should have a set of files like update.4_1 in
the subdirectory rawdata/.  If not, get the files update.4_1.tar.Z
from the ftp site, put them in the home directory, and run INSTALL
again.  The files in rawdata/ are in .ace text format, and must be
read by acedb and saved in binary format in the database/ directory.
To do this, start acedb by typing "acedb", click "Yes" to accept
initialising the database, and then when the main window comes up,
select "Add Update File" from the main menu (right button), and click
on the "All updates" button.  You will have to wait for some time (up
to several hours on slower machines) for all the data to load in.  A
progress report is given in the Update window.

Directory structure
===================

You will typically have $ACEDB (the home directory) layed out
something like as follows:

       acedb   		# executable script to be moved in /usr/local/bin
       textace  	# executable script to be moved in /usr/local/bin
       database/
	  ACEDB.wrm	# little file needed for acedb to run
          block1.wrm	# the database
          block2.wrm etc.   ""
	  database.map	# info on all the block* files
	  log.wrm	# log file
		# all these files in database/ are only created after
		# running acedb the first time
       bin/		# the executable(s)
	  xace		# X graphics version (usual interface)
	  tace		# command line version
	  acediff	# for comparing two ace files
       wspec/		# database dependent specification files.
	  GraphPackage	# X resources file - not needed
          cachesize.wrm # You may want to edit this file
	  copyright	
	  options.wrm   # You may want to edit this file
	  database.wrm	# specifies chunk sizes to split the database into
	  displays.wrm  # You may want to edit this file
	  models.wrm 	# database schema
	  help.wrm	# help
	  passwd.wrm    # User access control - see doc/WRITE_ACCESS
	  server.wrm	# control file for server/client version
	  subclasses.wrm # subclass schema information
	  xfonts.wrm    # Edit this to change screen fonts
	  psfonts.wrm   # Edit this file to change printing fonts
       rawdata/
	  update files

The minimal requirements for running acedb are that the database/ and
wspec/ directories exist, and wspec/ contains cachesize, options,
displays, models, passwd.  The files in database/ will be made as
necessary by the program - do not try to edit them yourself.  For
update files to load properly they must be in $ACEDB/rawdata.  The
executables can be somewhere other than $ACEDB/bin.  Sites with
multiple acedb databases can use the same executables for all of them.
Conversely, the same database files can be read by executables for
multiple machine types (at least within Unix systems), which will
require some reorganising of directories and/or file names.

To run the program you must either set the environment variable ACEDB
to the absolute path to the ACEDB home directory (by e.g.  "setenv
ACEDB ~acedb"), or make the home directory the first argument of xace
or tace on the command line (e.g. "xace ~acedb").  Of course xace must
be in your path.  All this is done most easily by moving the shell
scripts acedb and textace prepared by the INSTALL script into
/usr/local/bin, where they are set up for any user, who can then type
"acedb" or "textace" to run the X or command line versions,
respectively.

Help system
===========

The help system has been revised. We know have an in-lined html viewer
for local files. It is much fatser than Mosaic, and defaults to Mosaic
(or netscape as defined in wscripts/Mosaic) on http references.  The
help pages will be searched 1) in $ACEDB/whelp/*.html, 2) in
wspec/help.wrm. In case 1, we use the Prilusky system so you can
register help to a particualr class or tag in trre displays for
axemple wdir/Tree_Author_Paper.html, gives help oon tag paper in class
Author in Tree display.

Server Client:
==============

Acedb now has server client capabilities. But since this is useful
only in bigger laboratories, we do not precompile the server. The
documentation to do so in in the subdirectory wrpc. 


X-client in test
================

There is know an X-client in test. Its purpose is to give a complete
graphic acedb, without loading all the data. To use it, you must first
compile it (setenv ACEDB_SRC `pwd` ; setenv ACEDB_MACHINE ..)  then
(make xclient). Then you initialise a database on the current source
code distribution models with xace, but do not load any data. Then you
start xclient. Because that address is given in wspec/server.wrm, you
will automatically download data from Montpellier. If you then save
and run xace, you will work locally with the same data. But each time
you start xclient, you load again from the network. I would lie to
know a) if it works at all, b) if it is useful, c) how it should be
improved. 

WWW interface
=============

There are now three ways to serve the web: 

The Moulon server, which runs tace and exports precomputed images.

The perl server, documented on Bigwood's web page 
http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs/index.html
This systems runs off the aceserver, via a perl client, which is
part of the wrpc directory.

The java server, developped by Lincoln Stein (Whitehead-MIT) and JTM.
The Jade code is very preliminary and will be distributed later this
spring.It runs off the same aceserver, via a special: netclient
whcih is part of the acedb makefile. We expect Jade to change fast
but we hope that the netclient will be stable.

The hope is to fuse these various approaches into a stable product
within the next few months. Contact us is you are interested.

Known problems:
===============

On DEC stations, there is a font problem, Jack Leunissen reports
that on his DEC 5000, running ultrix 4.2, you can fix it this way:
        xset +fp ......
        mv fonts.alias-mit fonts.alias (in the MIT font dir)
        and then reboot your machine.
Alternatively, you can edit wspec/xfonts.wrm
Also, to recompile on the DEC, add in wh a symbolic link to mit X11:
        cd $ACEDB_SRC/wh ; ln -s /usr/include/mit/X11 X11

On Solaris machines you sometimes get messages saying that a library
can not be found, e.g. libXt.so.  It will be somewhere on your system.
You can avoid this by setting the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to include the relevant directory, in addition to the standard places
like /usr/lib.  This will get used to find the library at run time.
If you make the executable setuid this becomes harder, due to security
features of Solaris.  We hope we have made this problem less common in
the 4_1 release.

On some machines the lock file mechanism does not appear to work
correctly, so that no data can be read in (not even enough to
bootstrap initialisation).  You will see a message 
	"Don't-know-who (session 0) already has write access" 
even before the database exists.  To defeat the file locking
mechanism, set the environment variable ACEDB_NO_LOCK before starting
the program (e.g. "setenv ACEDB_NO_LOCK").  Of course if you do this
you are responsible for making sure that two people do not try to
update or edit the database at the same time.  Alternatively, create a
fake user "NOLOCK" in the wspec/passwd.wrm file.

The program is supposed to recognise monochrome and color screens.
This sometimes fails; if you understand why, please let us know.  In
case of problems with a black and white screen, try 'setenv
ACEDB_MONO', or alternatively, 'setenv ACEDB_COLOR', or 'setenv
ACEDB_GRAY'

Macintosh version
-----------------

For macace, the Macintosh version of acedb, look in directory macace/
of the ftp archive sites.  You need a Macintosh with absolute mimimum
16Mb of memory and a decent monitor.  You also need some way of
obtaining the files from an ftp site (e.g. Mosaic, Netscape, NCSA
telnet, Versaterm Pro...).

Additional Information 
======================

An on line help file is contained in ${ACEDB}/wspec/help.wrm and is
activated by the help option in the menu, or by function key F1 or
F10, or, on a Sun under twm, the help key.

Some documentation files are available in the doc/ subdirectory of the
distribution.  Amongst these, the nicest general user guide is
angistute, which was written by Bruno Gaeta of the Australian National
Genome Information Service, and is available as a compressed Unix
postscript file (angistute.ps.Z) and a Macintosh Word binhex/stuffit
compressed file (angistute.sit.hqx).  Although written for version 2
acedb, this is still very relevant for most uses.

Further information is available in files in the wdoc/ subdirectory of
the source distribution, and via the acedb documentation archive at
http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs/index.html.
