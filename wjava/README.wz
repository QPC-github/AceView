interfaced very easly into acedb

unfortunatelly the elemantary
drawLine function is much too slow
in javascriot because it is really
a colored <div> 

with obliques, forget it, 10 minutes per graph
with staight line a very very simple worm gene
takes 12 s to draw

i could optimise the js script in case h or v lines
