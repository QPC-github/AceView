What is here
--

This directory contains the database server.  You can make these
targets in the top level makefile:

	aceserver
	gifaceserver
	gifacemblyserver
	tgifacemblyserver

There is also a script to monitor the servers:

	servermonitor

There is an interactive text client that acts much like tace:

	aceclient

There is a web client  that is implemented as a cgi:

	aceview - makes all the binaries for the web server; see
		also 'cvs checkout AceView'
	av.cgi - the main query
	pfam.cgi - the pfam query
	blast.cgi - blast query

The X based graphical client named "xaceclient" does not work.
