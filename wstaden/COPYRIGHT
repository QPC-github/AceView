The modifications i have done are:

1) i wrote my own makefile as a section inside the acedb makefile
2) i modified a few file names to prevent conflicts with acedb file names
3) i added a few () to please the compiler 
4) i modified a little os.h (under #ifdef ACEDB) to simplify portability

All these modifications are trivialities which do not alter the original code
The modules are compiled by the acedb makefile in a static library: libstaden
which is then used in acedb applications like acembly by linking -lstaden
