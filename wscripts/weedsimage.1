Oops, sorry, I don't know whether we moved on after I sent you that, or I
accidentally sent you the wrong one.  Here's the one we (mainly Jean) made
that works.  It's pretty close to being able to cache the transferred file in
the local externalFiles directory, though I didn't test that feature and
looking at it now I think it may have a small bug.
