Subject: TreeGenes now using anonymous ftp for image retrieval
Cc: mieg@kaa.cnrs-mop.fr
Status: R


The public version of TreeGenes now uses a script to fetch images
via anonymous ftp.  The implication is that one need only distribute
the script rather than the voluminous image files.

This script is based on (a non-working) one composed by David Matthews
& Jean Thierry-Mieg:

--------------------------8< Cut here for tgxv >8------------------
#!/bin/csh
#
#	tgxv --fetch and display image using anonymous ftp
#
#	This script is called by TreeGenes (Dendrome ACEDB).
#
#	A typical invocation would be:
#		tgxv bas0001.gif
#
#	Eventually it will examine its argument in more detail
#	to determine machine and path.  There should probably
#	be a cooperating process on the repository machine.
#
#	We could leave the file lying around in, say, 
#	$ACEDB/externalFiles and then check to see if the file
#	is available locally before fetching it on subsequent
#	invocations.

# In this section determine machine and file to fetch
# based on arguments to the script.  This is a stub.
