Here's another interesting variant on image-handling.

I have TreeGenes set up so that instead of calling xv directly
it calls a script "tgxv" which interprets its argument and
then finds the image file.  This  allows me to directly
fetch images from the gopher directories on my machine.

Tgxv should eventually be capable of fetching the image from
any registered repository on the internet.  This will take
another program which I have not yet had the time to write.
Exactly what is entailed in "registration" is an open question.
