Jean, thanks for the tip about "\rm", I never heard of that.

I guess you want to store these images locally in $ACEDB/externalFiles to
cache the ones that get accessed so they don't have to be fetched repeatedly.
This seems reasonable.  Your version of the script works but gives an error
message and fails to cache if the local current working directory doesn't 
contain a directory 'images'.  I fixed this by using ':t' to get just the
filename from the pathname argument:

#!/bin/csh -f

# $ACEDB/externalFiles/weedsimage
# Dave Matthews, 3 May 93
# Transfer the named file ($1) from weeds.mgh.harvard.edu by anonymous ftp,
# and display it with xv.

# exampe
#Image : "Arabidopsis"
#Pick_me_to_call "weedsimage" "images/cs-20.gif"

#ftp -vn weeds << FTP_DONE
# 132.183.190.21 weeds.mgh.harvard.edu

if (! -f $1) then
 ftp -vn 132.183.190.21 << FTP_DONE
 user anonymous acedb@
 binary
 get $1 remoteimage.tmp
 quit
FTP_DONE
endif

if (-f remoteimage.tmp) then
  \mv remoteimage.tmp $1:t
endif

if (-f $1:t) then
 xv $1:t
else
 xv remoteimage.tmp
endif
